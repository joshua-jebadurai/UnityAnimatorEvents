AnimatorEvents for Mechanim
===========================
Version 1.0

AnimatorEvents is a simple plugin to add callback events for Mechanim Animator.

Introduction
Mechanim is awesome in so many ways and as much as it is really good for artist, it doesn’t share the same thing for programmers. Just trying to get what state the animator is currently playing can result in many lines of code. This script simplifies the whole process and makes it easier for programmers by giving them the power of C# Events and Delegates.
